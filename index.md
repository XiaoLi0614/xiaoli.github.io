## About Me

I recently graduated with a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from the University of California, Riverside (UCR). I was supervised by Prof. [Mohsen Lesani](https://mohsenlesani.github.io/). 

## Research Interest

I'm interested in the theory and practice of distributed systems, computer security, and programming languages. I'm particularly interested in the foundation of consensus and distributed system protocols in the heterogeneous trust setting. 

Currently, my research focus is designing efficient consensus protocols with open membership.

I'm currently a Research Scientist at Meta.

## News
**Sep/2024**:  I joined Meta as a Research Scientist.  
**Sep/2024**:  I successfully defended my Ph.D. dissertation "Heterogeneous Byzantine Replicated Systems". Big thanks to all the people who have supported me through this journey. Special thanks to my cat Boba and dog Ori.    
**Aug/2024**:  Our work (Brief Announcement: Reconfigurable Heterogeneous Quorum Systems) is accepted to DISC'24.  
**Mar/2024**:  I completed my internship at Chainlink Labs. Thanks for all the support from my mentor Dr. [Chrysa Stathakopoulou](https://chainlinklabs.com/research) and my manager [Lorenz Breidenbach](https://chainlinklabs.com/research).

## Ongoing Projects

**ReconÔ¨Ågurable Clustered Byzantine Replication**: We design reconfiguration protocols for SMR across multiple clusters. We formally prove the safety and liveness properties of the reconfigurable clustered Byzantine replication and implement this framework for both HotStuff and BFT-Smart. Our experiment results show that clustered BFT SMR provides high throughput and low latency with dynamic membership.


## Previous Projects

**Reconfigurable Heterogeneous Quorum Systems**:  We present **reconfiguration protocols** for heterogeneous quorum systems(HQS) in order to enable open membership for permissionless blockchains. We also presents trade-offs for the properties that reconfigurations can preserve, and accordingly, presents reconfiguration protocols and proves their correctness. We further present a **graph characterization of HQS**, and its application for reconfiguration optimization. I implemented reconfiguration protocols on top of Stellar blockchian. Our results are available on arXiv now: [Open](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02156)

**On the power of quorum subsumption for heterogeneous quorum systems**:  We prove an **impossibility result** that shows **quorum intersection, and quorum availability** is not sufficient for Byzantine reliable broadcast(BRB) and consensus in heterogenous quorum systems(HQS), where each process can select different quorums. Moreover, we propose **quorum-subsumption** to help achieve BRB and consensus with detailed protocols and proofs. Quorum-subsumption together with intersection and availability is so far the weakest condition we know for BRB and consensus in the HQS setting.

**Hamraz**:  How to have **confidentiality, integrity, and availability** with as few machine as possible for replicated objects? Better yet, we got the work done automatically. Our open-source project is available: [Hamraz: code](https://github.com/XiaoLi0614/Secure_Partition.git)

**Hampa**:  How to keep the **invariant and recency** of replicated objects as user specified with as little coordination as possible? Skip the manual labor and try out our tool with the help of program synthesis and the state-of-art SMT solver. Our tool and open source project are available: [Hampa: tool](https://github.com/XiaoLi0614/HampaAE), [Hampa: code](https://github.com/XiaoLi0614/CVCAutomation)
